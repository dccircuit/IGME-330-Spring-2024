## V. Attendance
Attendance is mandatory and you are expected to be on time. Lectures will start promptly at the beginning of class, and may be followed by an in-class assignment or exercise that you are expected to work on until the end of the meeting (i.e. no leaving early, or doing HW for a different course).

<hr>

## VI. Grading

### VI-A. Exams (30%)
- There will be two main exams (You can think of them as a midterm and final) covering concepts, as well as "write some code" questions. You will be given various styles of quizzes to help you study for these.

### VI-B. Quizzes (10%)
- There will be a variety of low-pressure quiz experiences.  There will some combination of:
  - Study Quizzes: based on readings & taken online with multiple attempts allowed
  - Practice Quizzes: taken in class with a limited timeframe, but for a relatively low grade value, and
  - Take-home Quizzes: one-attempt quizzes with open access to materials while you take it.

### VI-C. Exercises (20%)
- There will be approximately 20 exercises assigned during the semester that help you learn and practice concepts and get ready for the major "homeworks".  Some may be worth more or less than others and they may be of various types:
  - Practice Exercises: Exercises that help you build something similar to what you'll need to do in the future.
  - Check-off Exercises: Exercises started in class that we will ask you to complete and submit.
  - Other Exercises: Activities or Assignments that you'll be asked to complete and submit (or answer a couple questions about) to round out your web development knowledge or pick up an extra skill that you might want to use on a homework.

### VI-B. Homework Assignments (36%)
- Sometime referred to as "mini-projects"  Substantial assignments that you will given a week or so to complete, approximately 4 of these will be assigned during the semester.  When possible we'll try to provide ways for you to alter the project in a way that makes it better as a portfolio piece.

### VI-E. Attendance/Participation (4%)*
- If you are always on time for class, have no unexcused absences, and participate in any critiques or Slack-based activities that are expected, you'll get these 4 percentage points.
  - Each unexcused absence will deduct 1%, considerable lateness will deduct 0.5%.  After you've lost these 4 points, * **each additional occurance will deduct 5% from your final course average.**
- Missing class (or being habitually late) will often do harm to your performance in this class. 
  - You can request to be excused from a class meeting for a school or career related opportunity - write your instructor (via Slack DM) *in advance* of that class meeting. 
  - If you can't attend class for any reason, always let us know *in advance*. Simply telling us *afterward* that "I didn't come cause I was too sick", for example, will not automatically excuse your absence.


### VI-F. Grade Scale

Final course grades are determined using the following scale: 

| Class Average | Grade |
| ------------- | ----- |
| 90+%	| A |
| 80+%	| B |
| 70+%	| C |
| 65+%	| D |
| <65%	| F |

## VII. More grading policies

### VII-A. Late assignments
- Assignments will not be accepted late without the prior approval of the instructor.  Extension policies may vary by professor.  Contact your professor via Slack if you have special circumstances that may require an assignment extension.

### VII-B. Policy on Incomplete Grades
- Incomplete grades will be given only in the most exceptional circumstances, soley for issues that arise AFTER the 'W' deadline has passed, and then only by prior arrangement with the professor. Being overcommitted and/or not having enough time to complete your coursework is not sufficient justification for an "I". Instead, meet with the professor as early as possible in the semester if you're having difficulty. 

### VII-C. Academic Integrity
- As part of the RIT academic community, it is imperative that you maintain the highest standards of academic honesty in this course. This policy outlines our commitment to uphold academic integrity and the consequences of violating it.
  - Cheating: Engaging in any form of fraudulent or deceptive academic act, including falsification of data and unauthorized possession or use of materials, sources, or tools.  See also our Generative AI policy (next section).
  - Collusion: Inappropriate collaboration with others in work that is meant to be completed individually.
  - Plagiarism: Representing the ideas of others as your own without proper attribution.
  - Duplicate Submission: Submitting work in this course that you have previously submitted in this course or another, without prior approval. Importantly, if you have previously taken this course and are retaking it (whether due to a withdrawal or to improve a grade), all submitted work must be original and created anew for this semester. Resubmitting past work, even your own, without explicit permission is not allowed and will be treated as a breach of academic integrity.

- Consequences: Breaches of academic integrity, including but not limited to cheating, collusion, plagiarism, and duplicate submission, will result in serious disciplinary action. This may range from failing the assignment to potentially failing the course, depending on the violation’s severity. Each case will be carefully reviewed in accordance with the RIT Academic Integrity Policy.

- For full details on the policy and your responsibilities within it, please visit [RIT's Academic Integrity website](https://www.rit.edu/academicintegrity/).


### VII-D. Generative AI ([ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) etc)
- Coding solutions must be your own work, which means you cannot use generative AI tools in any manner to write your programs for you.  Doing so would count as Cheating above.  When learning fundamental skills, you need to ensure that *you* master the basics. If we doubt authorship, we may ask you to explain the code or re-create aspects of the code in one of our labs – you must show that you have mastered the fundamentals. 

- We’ll occasionally work with some of those tools so that you can learn to use them effectively. In general, however, before resorting to the use of AI to create content submitted in this class you should communicate with your instructor. If and when you do use AI assistance, you should explicitly acknowledge so and describe how and to what extent AI was utilized in your documentation.
