## II. What's the format?
- myCourses Quiz
- Question types: multiple choice, true/false, short answer, "write some code", ... pretty much anything is possible.
- the exam will be designed to take approximately an hour to 100 minutes.

## III. What's NOT on it?

- There will not be any "write canvas code" questions on the exam

## IV. Other notes.

- Plan to be on time.  You should have plenty of time to take the Final Exam.  Emergency late arrivals can start late, but wonâ€™t be allowed time beyond what is left available.
- If you have extended time due to an accommodation, we still recommend taking the exam in the regular time slot.  Because the exam is designed for much shorter than the 2.5 hr time slot, you should have plenty of time, plus there are other benefits to being in person.
- You may bring up to 3 two-sided sheets of paper with notes.  These may be inspected/photographed.  You may reuse the sheet from the midterm if you wish (possibly with additional notes on it).  It does not need to be hand-written, but anything besides the midterm "notes sheet" should be your own creation (no shared crib-sheet distribution, please).
- You may also have blank scrap paper (and pen/pencil) if you want to use it.
- You may use the internet/search engines to look up information such as from MDN, O'Reilly, or from our GitHub tutorial pages.
- You may NOT use any form of Generative AI such as ChatGPT, Google Bard, Bing Co-Pilot, etc.  Some search engines are now automatically giving AI results inline.  Do not copy/paste questions from the exam into any search tools.
- You may NOT use a Code Editor (whether online or VS Code) or a JavaScript REPL. -- Honestly, it would probably slow you down way to much if you concerned yourself with getting it exactly right, anyway.
- You may NOT use any form of two way communication or use screen sharing utilities.
- You may NOT take down any notes about the exam content/questions or take any screenshots during the exam.
- If in doubt, raise your hand and ask the Professor.
